It handles CRUD operations for products and orders, implements Redis caching for performance optimization, and integrates rate-limiting middleware to manage API request loads. This component is responsible for ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage through MySQL database indexing and query optimization, fulfilling all container requirements.', 'interfaces': '', 'algorithms': '', 'pseudocode': '', 'local_backend_service': [], 'asset_images_b64': {}, 'available_assets': []}",
